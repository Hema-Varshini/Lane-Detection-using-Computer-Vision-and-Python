Lane detection, a critical component of self-driving cars and autonomous vehicles. Once lane
positions are obtained, the vehicle will know where to travel and avoid the danger of running
into other lanes or getting off the road. It is one among the foremost important research
topics for driving scene understanding. Once lane positions are obtained, the vehicle will
know where to travel and avoid the danger of running into other lanes or getting off the
road.

This will prevent the driver/car system from drifting off the driving lane. There are multiple
ways we'll perform lane detection. We will use the learning-based approaches, like training a
deep learning model, However, there are simpler methods to perform lane detection also .
during this guided project, we'll guide you in detecting lanes using Computer Vision with the
favored OpenCV library in python.

Few operations performed in this project are:
a) Image Processing
b) Feature Detection
c) Drawing figures
d) Video Processing
The proposed system uses the following software and hardware:
a) Python
b) OpenCV
c) Visual Studio/Anaconda/IDLE

5.FLOWCHART
a) Capturing and decoding video file frame by frame
b) Conversion of the Image to GrayScale for accuracy and speed
c) Applying filters to reduce noise in video frames
d) Edge Detection Using Canny Edge detection method
e) Finding the region of interest and working on that part
f) Detecting lanes using Computer Vision Wrapping Technique.
